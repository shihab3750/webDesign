      <h3>What I am up to</h3>
      <p>
        I am now a 20 years old in college. Life is a lot different. I grew as a person and learned it is okay to be different. Learned to apprecaite my heritage and our cultural background. I am attending one of the most prestigous University in our country. As a child of immigrant, life wasn't a slide but I learend to persevere. Obviously, there's a lot more ahead of me but I think I am at a good trajectory point.
