      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p><p> My name is Safin Shihab. I am a junior majoring in Computer Science at Tandon School of Engineering.<br> I am taking this course because I want to 
        brush up my knowledge on webdesigns. I have some prior <br> experience with web designs but I want to make sure my foundation is good as most of what I 
        learned <br> was through subreddits and youtube videos. Click on the links below to learn more about me!
